     * This field does not exist in the actual "room_players" table schema.

     * Supabase joins the "players" table, adding the `name` field from "players".
     * 
     * Since TypeScript does not automatically infer this, we add `players?: { name: string }`
     * to prevent errors when accessing `rp.players?.name` in our React components.
     * 
     * Note: The `?` makes it optional because not every query includes this join.
